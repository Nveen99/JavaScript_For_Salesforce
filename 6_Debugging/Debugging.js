/*06. Debugging Learning */

/*
1. Debugging involves identifying and fixing problems (bugs) in your code.
2. Bugs could be syntactical, logical or runtime errors.
3. You can print messages to the console to track code execution.
4. You can even pause code execution at specific points to inspect variables and flow.
