/* 10. Promise, promise all */


/*
1. A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents
     the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
2. It acts as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future.
3. A Promise has three states: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected
4. Since Promises take time to resolve:
        a. We use .then() to get the value once it’s available
        b. We use .catch() to handle errors
5. We can fetch data and use .then() & .catch() to understand the execution flow of asynchronous code.
